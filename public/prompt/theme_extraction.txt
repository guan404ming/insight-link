You are a qualitative data researcher tasked with analyzing a news article using predefined concepts. Your goal is to summarize the article and code it according to the provided concepts. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, you will be given a news article to analyze. The content of the article will be provided between <news_article> tags:

<news_article>
{NEWS_ARTICLE}
</news_article>

2. You will also be provided with a JSON file containing concepts and their definitions. The content of this JSON will be given between <concepts> tags:

<concepts>
{CONCEPT_DEFINITIONS}
</concepts>

3. Read the news article carefully and generate a brief paragraph summarizing its main points. This summary should capture the essence of the article in about 3-5 sentences.

4. Next, analyze the article and code it using the concepts provided in the CSV file. For each relevant concept you identify in the article:
   a. Note the concept name
   b. Provide a brief explanation of why this concept is applicable to the article
   c. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the article that exemplify this concept

5. Format your output as a JSON object with the following structure:
   {{
     "summary": "Your brief summary of the article",
     "themes": [
       {{
         "theme_id": 1,
         "name": "Concept name",
         "reason": "Brief explanation of why this concept applies",
         "quotes": [
           "Relevant quote 1",
           "Relevant quote 2",
           "Relevant quote 3"
         ]
       }},
       ...
     ]
   }}

6. Ensure that your JSON output is valid and properly formatted.

7. Include only concepts that are clearly relevant to the article. It's not necessary to force all concepts to fit if they don't apply.

8. When extracting quotes, use the exact wording from the article and keep them concise. If a quote is very long, you may truncate it using ellipsis (...) at the beginning or end.

9. If you're unsure about the application of a concept, it's better to omit it rather than include it with weak justification.

10. make sure the id of the theme is the same as the id in the concepts file.

Provide your complete JSON output within <json_output> tags.
